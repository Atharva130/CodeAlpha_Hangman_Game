# 🎯 CodeAlpha - Hangman Game

Hello there! 👋  
This is my completed project for the **Hangman Game task** as part of the **CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship**. This classic game has been reimagined with visuals, input validation, and multiple play sessions — all built using Python fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 Game Overview

The Hangman Game challenges users to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed or the drawing is complete.

What makes this version more advanced:
- Polished ASCII-based hangman drawings for 7 stages
- Multiple rounds supported
- Validations for repeated or invalid input

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Random word selection from file or default list
- ✅ Visual ASCII art hangman stages
- ✅ Full input validation
- ✅ Tracks guessed letters
- ✅ Replay support after each game

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3
- `random` module
- Basic I/O, loops, sets, conditionals

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. (Optional) Create a `words.txt` file with one word per line.
3. Run the game:

```bash
python hangman.py
